# ✅ Event Details Modal Implemented

## 🎉 Complete!

I've converted the Event Details view from a sidebar to a properly styled modal.

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

1.  **Modal Overlay**:
    -   Darkened background (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)`) to focus attention on the modal.
    -   Centered on the screen.

2.  **Clean Layout**:
    -   **Header**: Clear title ("Event Details") with a close button.
    -   **Body**: Two-column grid layout for details (Name, DOB, Status, etc.).
    -   **Footer**: Action buttons (Edit, Delete, Close) aligned to the right.

3.  **Professional Styling**:
    -   White background with shadow (`box-shadow: 0 4px 12px ...`).
    -   DHIS2 typography and colors.
    -   Responsive design (max-width 90%).
