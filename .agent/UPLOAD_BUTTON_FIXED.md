# ✅ Upload Button Icon Fixed

## 🎉 Complete!

I've resized the "plus" icon in the "Upload New Document" button to be properly proportioned.

---

## 🎨 Changes Made

1. **Icon Size**:
   - Set explicit width and height to **20px** for the SVG inside the primary button.
   - This prevents the icon from being too large or inheriting incorrect sizes.

---

## 🚀 Visual Result

- **Balanced**: The icon now matches the text size perfectly.
- **Professional**: The button looks clean and polished.

## 🎯 How to Test

1. **Refresh your browser**
2. Go to **TKP Documents** -> **Documents For TKP**
3. Look at the **"Upload New Document"** button.
4. The plus icon should now be a reasonable size.

**The interface is looking sharp!** 🔪
