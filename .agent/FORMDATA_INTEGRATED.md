# ✅ FormDataDisplay Integrated

## 🎉 Complete!

I've integrated the `FormDataDisplay` component into the Capture app's details modal.

---

## 🚀 What's New

1.  **Rich Details View**:
    -   Instead of a simple summary, the modal now shows **ALL** the data from the form.
    -   It automatically adapts to show relevant sections (e.g., Pregnancy Info, Medical History, Family Composition) based on the form data.

2.  **Better Layout**:
    -   Widened the modal to **900px** to comfortably fit the detailed information.
    -   Maintained the clean header and footer actions (Edit, Delete, Close).

## 🔍 How to Test

1.  **Refresh your browser**
2.  Go to **Capture** app.
3.  Click the **View (Eye)** button on any child.
4.  **Success!** You will now see the full `FormDataDisplay` inside the modal, showing every detail of the child's record.

**Now you have the full power of the form display inside the Capture app!** 💪
