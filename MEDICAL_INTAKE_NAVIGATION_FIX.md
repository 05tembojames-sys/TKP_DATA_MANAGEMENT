# Medical Intake Forms Button - Navigation Fix

## Issue

When clicking the "Medical Intake Forms" button in the "In Housed Girls" section, the form was not opening correctly.

## Root Cause

The original implementation tried to navigate using `router.push()` with query parameters to the root path `/`. However, since the ChildTracker component is rendered within the Dashboard (not at a separate route), the query parameters were not being processed correctly.

## Solution

Changed the navigation approach from router-based to event-based communication between components.

### Changes Made

#### 1. ChildTracker Component (`src/components/ChildTracker.vue`)

**Updated Emits:**

```javascript
// Before
const emit = defineEmits(["back-to-dashboard"]);

// After
const emit = defineEmits(["back-to-dashboard", "navigate-to-medical-intake"]);
```

**Updated Navigation Function:**

```javascript
// Before
const goToMedicalIntakeForms = () => {
  router.push({
    path: "/",
    query: { view: "data-entry", form: "medical-intake-list" },
  });
};

// After
const goToMedicalIntakeForms = () => {
  // Emit event to Dashboard to switch to medical intake forms
  emit("navigate-to-medical-intake");
};
```

**Why This Works:**

- Emits an event that the parent Dashboard component can listen to
- Simpler and more direct communication pattern
- Doesn't rely on router query parameters

#### 2. Dashboard Component (`src/components/Dashboard.vue`)

**Updated ChildTracker Component:**

```vue
<!-- Before -->
<ChildTracker
  :show-only-complete="currentView === 'child-tracker-2'"
  @back-to-dashboard="setCurrentView('main')"
/>

<!-- After -->
<ChildTracker
  :show-only-complete="currentView === 'child-tracker-2'"
  @back-to-dashboard="setCurrentView('main')"
  @navigate-to-medical-intake="handleNavigateToMedicalIntake"
/>
```

**Added Handler Function:**

```javascript
const handleNavigateToMedicalIntake = () => {
  // Switch to data entry view
  currentView.value = "data-entry";
  // Set to medical intake forms list
  currentForm.value = "medical-intake-list";
  selectedFormType.value = "medical-intake";
};
```

**What This Does:**

1. Switches the main view to "data-entry"
2. Sets the current form to "medical-intake-list"
3. Updates the selected form type to "medical-intake"
4. The Dashboard then renders the Medical Intake Forms list

## How It Works Now

### User Flow

1. User navigates to **"In Housed Girls - Complete Forms Only"**
2. User clicks the **purple "Medical Intake Forms"** button
3. ChildTracker emits `navigate-to-medical-intake` event
4. Dashboard receives the event via `@navigate-to-medical-intake` listener
5. Dashboard handler function executes:
   - `currentView` → "data-entry"
   - `currentForm` → "medical-intake-list"
   - `selectedFormType` → "medical-intake"
6. Dashboard re-renders showing the Data Entry section
7. Medical Intake Assessment Forms list is displayed
8. User can now view/add/edit medical intake forms

### Component Communication Flow

```
ChildTracker (Child)
    ↓ emit("navigate-to-medical-intake")
Dashboard (Parent)
    ↓ @navigate-to-medical-intake="handleNavigateToMedicalIntake"
handleNavigateToMedicalIntake()
    ↓ Updates state
    ├─ currentView = "data-entry"
    ├─ currentForm = "medical-intake-list"
    └─ selectedFormType = "medical-intake"
Dashboard Re-renders
    ↓
Shows Data Entry Section
    ↓
Displays Medical Intake Forms List
```

## Testing

### Test Steps

1. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Login to the system**

3. **Navigate to "In Housed Girls"**

   - Click the "In Housed Girls" button on dashboard
   - Verify you see "In Housed Girls - Complete Forms Only" title

4. **Click the Medical Intake Forms button**

   - Look for the purple button in Quick Stats section
   - Button should have medical document icon and text "MEDICAL INTAKE FORMS"
   - Click the button

5. **Verify Navigation**

   - Should switch to Data Entry view
   - Should show "Medical Intake Assessment Forms" tab as active
   - Should display the forms list table
   - Should see "Add New Medical Intake Assessment" button

6. **Test Adding a Form**
   - Click "Add New Medical Intake Assessment"
   - Form should open with all 9 sections
   - Complete and submit a test form
   - Should return to forms list

### Expected Results

✅ Button appears in "In Housed Girls" view  
✅ Clicking button navigates to Medical Intake Forms  
✅ Data Entry view loads correctly  
✅ Medical Intake forms list is displayed  
✅ Can add new forms  
✅ Can view existing forms  
✅ Navigation is smooth without errors

## Benefits of New Approach

### 1. **More Reliable**

- No dependency on router query parameters
- Direct parent-child communication
- Fewer points of failure

### 2. **Simpler Code**

- Clear event flow
- Easier to debug
- Better separation of concerns

### 3. **Better Performance**

- No route change overhead
- Instant view switching
- No URL manipulation needed

### 4. **More Maintainable**

- Standard Vue event pattern
- Easy to extend with additional navigation events
- Clear function names and intent

## Previous vs Current Implementation

### Previous (Router-Based)

```javascript
// ChildTracker.vue
const goToMedicalIntakeForms = () => {
  router.push({
    path: "/",
    query: { view: "data-entry", form: "medical-intake-list" },
  });
};

// Dashboard.vue
onMounted(() => {
  const query = router.currentRoute.value.query;
  if (query.view) {
    currentView.value = query.view;
    if (query.form) {
      currentForm.value = query.form;
    }
  }
});
```

**Issues:**

- Navigates to root path, losing current context
- Query parameters processed only on mount
- Browser URL changes unnecessarily
- Can cause issues with Vue Router navigation guards

### Current (Event-Based)

```javascript
// ChildTracker.vue
const emit = defineEmits(["navigate-to-medical-intake"]);
const goToMedicalIntakeForms = () => {
  emit("navigate-to-medical-intake");
};

// Dashboard.vue
const handleNavigateToMedicalIntake = () => {
  currentView.value = "data-entry";
  currentForm.value = "medical-intake-list";
  selectedFormType.value = "medical-intake";
};
```

**Advantages:**

- Direct parent-child communication
- No route changes
- Immediate state updates
- Clean and simple

## Troubleshooting

### Button Still Not Working

**Check Console for Errors:**

```javascript
// Browser Console (F12)
// Look for:
// - Vue warnings
// - JavaScript errors
// - Failed emit events
```

**Verify Event Listener:**

```vue
<!-- In Dashboard.vue, verify this exists: -->
<ChildTracker @navigate-to-medical-intake="handleNavigateToMedicalIntake" />
```

**Test Event Emission:**
Add temporary console log in ChildTracker:

```javascript
const goToMedicalIntakeForms = () => {
  console.log("Emitting navigate-to-medical-intake event");
  emit("navigate-to-medical-intake");
};
```

**Test Event Handler:**
Add temporary console log in Dashboard:

```javascript
const handleNavigateToMedicalIntake = () => {
  console.log("Medical intake navigation handler called");
  currentView.value = "data-entry";
  currentForm.value = "medical-intake-list";
  selectedFormType.value = "medical-intake";
};
```

### Other Issues

**Button Not Visible:**

- Ensure you're in "In Housed Girls" view (not "Child Tracker")
- Check `showOnlyComplete` prop is `true`
- Verify CSS is not hiding the button

**Wrong View Displayed:**

- Check `currentView` value in Vue DevTools
- Verify `currentForm` is "medical-intake-list"
- Check Dashboard conditional rendering logic
