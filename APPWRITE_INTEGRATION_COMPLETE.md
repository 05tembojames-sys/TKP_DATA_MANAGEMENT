---

## 📋 What Was Done

### 1. Appwrite Client Setup ✅
**File**: `src/lib/appwrite.js`
- ✅ Appwrite Client configured
- ✅ Storage instance created
- ✅ ID utility exported

### 2. Environment Variables ✅
**File**: `.env`
```env
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID = "68f4e1b50036be12f797"
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_NAME = "TKP"
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT = "https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1"
VITE_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID = "68f4e202003c4faca141"  ✅ FIXED (was VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET_ID)
```

### 3. Report Service Updated ✅
**File**: `src/services/reportService.js`

**Upload Method**:
- ✅ Replaced Firebase Storage with Appwrite Storage
- ✅ Uses `storage.createFile(bucketId, ID.unique(), file)`
- ✅ Generates both view URL and download URL
- ✅ Stores `appwriteFileId` and `appwriteBucketId` in Firestore

**Delete Method**:
- ✅ Updated to accept `appwriteFileId` and `appwriteBucketId`
- ✅ Uses `storage.deleteFile(bucketId, fileId)`
- ✅ Graceful error handling

### 4. Reports Component Updated ✅
**File**: `src/components/Reports.vue`
- ✅ Delete function passes correct Appwrite parameters
- ✅ All other functionality remains unchanged

## 🎯 How It Works

### File Upload Flow
```
User selects file → Reports.vue → ReportService.uploadReport()
                                         ↓
                    1. Upload file to Appwrite Storage
                    2. Get file view URL and download URL
                    3. Save metadata to Firestore with:
                       - appwriteFileId
                       - appwriteBucketId
                       - fileUrl (view)
                       - downloadURL (download)
```

### File Delete Flow
```
User clicks delete → Reports.vue → ReportService.deleteReport(id, fileId, bucketId)
                                         ↓
                    1. Delete file from Appwrite Storage
                    2. Delete document from Firestore
```
