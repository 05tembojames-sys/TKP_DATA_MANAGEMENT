# 🔧 Fix User Login Issue - Update User Roles

## Problem
Users created through the Dashboard cannot log in because they were created without the "admin" role.

**Root Cause:**
- The Dashboard didn't have a role field when creating users
- UserService defaults to role: "user" when no role is specified  
- AuthService only allows users with role: "admin" to log in
- Result: Users can't log in!

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Code Changes Made:

1. **Dashboard.vue** - Added role field to user creation form
   - Users can now select: Administrator, User, Manager, or Viewer
   - Defaults to "Administrator" 
   - Shows warning: "Only administrators can log in to the system"

2. **Default Role** - Set to "admin" for all new users created from Dashboard

## 🛠️ Fix Existing Users

You have 2 options to fix the users you already created:

### **Option A: Update Users in Firebase Console (RECOMMENDED)**

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project: **khukomaproject**
3. Go to **Firestore Database**
4. Find the **users** collection
5. For each user document:
   - Click on the document
   - Find the `role` field
   - Change the value from `"user"` to `"admin"`
   - Click **Update**
6. Try logging in again

**Visual Guide:**
```
Firebase Console
  → Firestore Database
    → users (collection)
      → [user-document-id]
        → role: "user"  ❌ Change this to "admin" ✅
```

---

### **Option B: Delete and Recreate Users**

If you prefer to start fresh:

1. In the Dashboard, go to **User Management** section
2. Delete the existing users
3. Create new users using the **Add User** button
4. Select **"Administrator"** role from the dropdown
5. Complete the form and submit
6. Users can now log in!

## 📋 Checklist for Each User

For every user that needs to log in:

- [ ] User exists in Firebase Auth (Authentication section)
- [ ] User document exists in Firestore `users` collection
- [ ] User document has `role: "admin"` field
- [ ] User email and password are correct

## 🔐 User Roles Explained

| Role | Can Log In? | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **admin** | ✅ Yes | Full system access, can log in |
| **user** | ❌ No | Regular user (current restriction) |
| **manager** | ❌ No | Manager level (current restriction) |
| **viewer** | ❌ No | View-only access (current restriction) |

**Note:** Currently, only "admin" role can log in. This is a security feature in [`auth.js`](file://c:\Users\james\Desktop\khukoma-project\src\services\auth.js#L70-L73).

## 🧪 Test Login After Fix

1. Open your application: `npm run dev`
2. Go to login page
3. Try logging in with user credentials:
   - Email: [user-email]
   - Password: [user-password]
4. **Expected Result:** ✅ Successful login, redirected to dashboard

## 🔍 Verify User Setup in Firebase

### Check Firebase Auth:
```
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Authentication → Users

4. Check if email is verified (not required for login)
```

### Check Firestore Users Collection:
```
1. Go to Firebase Console  
2. Navigate to Firestore Database → users
3. Find user document by email
4. Verify these fields exist:
   - uid: (matches Firebase Auth UID)
   - email: [user-email]
   - role: "admin"  ← MUST BE "admin"
   - fullName or name: [user-name]
   - createdAt: [timestamp]
```

## 🚀 Create New Admin User (From Scratch)

If you need to create a new admin user now:

1. Open your application
2. Log in with your existing admin account
3. Click **"User Management"** button on dashboard
4. Click **"Add User"** (or **"+ Add User"** button)
5. Fill in the form:
   ```
   Full Name: John Doe
   Email: john@example.com
   Password: YourSecurePassword123
   Phone Number: +260977123456
   Role: Administrator  ← IMPORTANT!
   ```
6. Click **"Create User"**
7. ✅ User can now log in immediately!

## 📝 Future Improvement Suggestions

If you want to allow non-admin users to log in later, you can modify [`auth.js`](file://c:\Users\james\Desktop\khukoma-project\src\services\auth.js):

```javascript
// Current code (line 70-73):
if (!userDoc || userDoc.role !== 'admin') {
  await this.logout()
  throw new Error('Access denied: Admin privileges required')
}

// To allow all roles:
if (!userDoc) {
  await this.logout()
  throw new Error('User data not found')
}
// Remove the role check entirely
```

But keep "admin" check for now to maintain security!
